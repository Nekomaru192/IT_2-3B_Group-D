          <h1><b>ABOUT US</b></h1>
          <h1><b>Pandayan Bookshop</b></h1>
          <p>
            <b>Pandayan Bookshop</b> is a proudly Filipino-owned company
            established in 1993 by <b>G. Valeriano "Bong" P. Tarrayo</b> in
            <b>Candelaria, Quezon</b>. What began as a small neighborhood store
            was built on a simple yet powerful vision — to create a
            <b>Tindahan ng Buhay (Store of Life)</b>: a place that goes beyond
            transactions and becomes an integral part of the community’s
            everyday life.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the very beginning, Pandayan Bookshop has been guided by its
            mission to provide
            <b>papel, panulat, at pangarap (paper, pen, and dreams)</b> to every
            Filipino. More than selling school and office supplies, we aim to be
            a <b>partner in every person’s journey</b> — nurturing creativity,
            learning, and inspiration.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the heart of our success is the
            <b>Kultura ng Tagumpay (Culture of Success)</b> — an internal
            guiding principle that places our employees, known as Kapwa Panday,
            at the center of everything we do. This culture of teamwork,
            respect, and shared purpose has helped shape Pandayan into what it
            is today.
          </p>
          <p>
            From our humble beginnings in Candelaria, Pandayan Bookshop has
            grown into a well-loved brand with
            <b>numerous branches across Luzon</b> and is now expanding into
            <b>Visayas and Mindanao</b>. Through the years, we have remained
            committed to our founding values —
            <b>community, growth, and inspiration</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, Pandayan Bookshop stands not just as a retail store, but as a
            <b>place for inspiration</b> — a space where dreams are encouraged,
            creativity thrives, and every Filipino is empowered to write their
            own story.
